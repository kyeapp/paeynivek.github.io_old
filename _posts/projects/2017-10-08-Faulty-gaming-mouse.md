<p>
My brother's mouse started acting up. The left click switch ocasionally stopped responding. I opened the mouse and performed a continuity test on the left microswitch. I was able to reproduce the issue; The switch does not make contact sometimes despite being pressed. I confirmed that the switch was faulty by testing the right one and it performed as expected. A simple microswitch replacement should fix the issue.

Faulty microswitch removed from the mouse's circuit board.

I also performed a quick continuity test on both switches before soldering them in just in case they were dead on arrival (DOA).

The new switches soldered in!

I decided to replace both the left and right click to keep the feel of the clicks consistent. The replacement switches seem require a slightly longer travel distance and and seem to require a tiny bit more actuation force than the ones I replaced. Feels a bit more difficult to double click as quick. Maybe I should find microswitches with actuation lighter than 70g next time. Continuity test confirms everything seems to be in working order.
