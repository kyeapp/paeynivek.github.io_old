3. <h3>Tools. Startup. </h3>
Sometimes when you install program you give it permission to startup  process for itself when you open your computer. A lot of the times Malware and viruses are also set to run on startup which will further cripple your computer. Disable everything that is pretty much not a driver. Be very wary of anything that has a blank in the publisher section. Leave anything you want to run when you turn on your computer enabled.

6. <h3>Dusting.</h3>
Dust accumalation will insulate your electronics and prevent airflow for cooling. Operating your computer at high temperates is a great way to shorten the lifespan of computers and laptop batteries.
Physically open up your computer and vacuum the dust. Using compressed air or a small soft brush is recommended. 

7. <h3>Run your anti-virus scanner.</h3>
If you have no anti-virus. AVG is a reputable anti-virus and has been around a while. The free version is good enough.
