<p>This is the first post of my blog. I started this blog to showcase projects that I work on and my thought process to completing them. I started by writing the blog in html from scratch, which was a mistake. I quickly realized that I was probably better off using some technologies to build my website fastier and make it easier to host and maintain. I decided to use Jekyll because it excelled at static page generation, perfect for blogging, and I would be able to host on github easily. I liked the Minimal Mistakes theme so I forked from there. I have 2 main sections, <a href="https://paeynivek.github.io/projects/">Projects</a> for coding/general projects and <a href="https://paeynivek.github.io/3d-prints/">3D Prints</a> for my 3d printed projects. My first priorities were to get the blog hosted, then I could slowly tune it to how I liked after I wrote this first post.</p>
